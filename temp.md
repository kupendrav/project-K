❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will lead to a reference error when
the function is executed if `a` and `b` are not defined in the scope where the function is called.
* ❌ Function lacks parameters, making it inflexible and reliant on variables in its outer scope.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters.
* ✔ The function now returns the sum of these two parameters.
* ✔ The function is self-contained and doesn't rely on external variables.
